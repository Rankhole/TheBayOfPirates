                    Torrents themselves are not illegal, they are just a way
                    of sharing files with other people, regardless
                    of whether they're legal or illegal.
                    Since torrents utilize peer-to-peer networking, it's possible
                    to "host" files without actually having a server.
                    This project is obviously not discussing the legality or ethicality of
                    piracy. Piracy can be done with or without torrents! This is not the
                    topic of this project.
