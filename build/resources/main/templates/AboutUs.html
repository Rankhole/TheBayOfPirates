<p>This is a project by: Muhammed Ali Geldi & Ali Aslan</p>
Current time according to model:
<p th:text=" ${localdatetime} ">Current local date and time</p>
<pre>Project goals:
    1) Enable (legal) torrent sharing/down- and uploading
    2) Build a solid foundation for a torrent-caring community
    3) Rating system for torrents
</pre>
<pre><i>Note: Torrents themselves are not illegal, they are just a way
of sharing files (no matter if legal/illegal) with other people.
Because torrents utilize peer-to-peer networking, they make it possible
to "host" files without actually having a server.
This project is obviously not discussing the legality or ethicality of
piracy. Piracy can be done with or without torrents! This is not the
    topic of our project. </i>
